# BootstrapNavBar
About: Assignment adding a Bootstrap Nav Bar to react components with routing a web page. Added in some CSS styles.

Roadmap for future improvement: I would like to improve the content on the webpages and then add links at the top that would navigate to specific points on the page.  I would also like to actually create a sign in page, that would then allow access to the about and mission pages as well.
